# GSET_SAR

Search and Rescue (SAR) operations take place in environments where time is critical. Human-led efforts can be significantly resource-intensive and dangerous. There is a strong need for real-time situational awareness in disaster zones such as earthquakes, wildfires, and tropical storms. Such a problem requires an autonomous system to swiftly detect survivors, identify distress signals, and relay critical information to rescue teams. 

Current SAR technology faces significant challenges related to limited on-device AI processing, inefficient decision-making, and significant communication bottlenecks. In disaster regions, traditional wireless infrastructure can be limited or nonexistent, and the need for near-instantaneous decision-making necessitates strong computational capabilities on-device.
